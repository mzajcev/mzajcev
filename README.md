### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matthias Zajcev and I am from Cologne, Germany. I'm a University of Applied Sciences Cologne graduate and currently focussing on my Masters degree.
I love to extend and generate new knowledge in various fields to become an expert in Data Science with focus on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
Here's a bit more about me:

```python
matthias = {
    "pronouns": "he/him",
    "current_role": "Data Analyst",
    "code_skills": ["HTML", "CSS", "Python", "SQL"],
    "tools": ["Snowflake SQL", "Apache Superset", "PowerBI", "SPSS"],
    "architecture": ["microservices", "event-driven", "design system pattern"],
    "interests": {
        "NLP": ["Sentiment Analysis", "Topic Modeling", "Langchain", "Large Language Models (LLMs)"],
        "ML": [
            "Predictive Modeling", 
            "Data Mining", 
            "Clustering Algorithms", 
            "Dimensionality Reduction", 
            "Embeddings"
        ]
    }
}


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on clustering unsupervised data with reduced dimensionality to generate knowledge in a business setting.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything in the direction of NLP / ML.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Preferrable on LinkedIn.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like coffeine.
