<h3 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h3>

<p align="center">
  My name is Matthias Zajcev and I am from Cologne, Germany. 
    I'm a University of Applied Sciences Cologne graduate and currently focussing on my Masters degree.
  I love to extend and generate new knowledge in various fields to become an expert in Data Science with focus on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

```python
matthias = {
    "current_role": "Data Analyst",
    "code_skills": ["HTML", "CSS", "C++", "Python", "SQL"],
    "tools": ["Snowflake SQL", "Apache Superset", "PowerBI", "SPSS", "Pandas", "spaCy", "Langchain", "Transformers", "Scikit-learn" & many more],
    "architecture": ["microservices", "event-driven", "design system pattern"],

            "Predictive Modeling", 
            "Data Mining", 
            "Clustering Algorithms", 
            "Dimensionality Reduction", 
            "Embeddings"
        ]
    }
}

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on clustering unsupervised data with reduced dimensionality to discover knowledge in a business setting.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything in the direction of NLP / ML.
